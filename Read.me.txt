dyanamic page add garnu cha vaney we can do that with help of DTL
DTL is specifically built for developers to embed Django logic codes into HTML template files.

web page needed data layout and logic. sometimes it is good to separate this 3 things and MVT does it.
MVT->model view template
Model -> data. Data is coming from databases
Templates -> layout, The template is the presentation layer.
Eg: When we(user) want to fetch data so we request and this req will go to web application(django framewok) in django whenever you build a project
you will get a specific file URLs it does all the mapping and so that navigation will be sent to views so that bussiness logic which we want to write 
will be done in views and this views will use the model objects and templates. View connected with model and templates
